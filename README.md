# Development-of-Features-and-Components-for-ECommerce-Websites

This is my MCA final semester project. I have prepared the document based on my working experience as an intern in GetPy.biz, a software company in Bangalore.

I have worked on WooCommerce and Elementor for designing webpages and creating ecommerce platform for an Wordpress Website.

I have also worked on Google Tag Manager, a central tag manager to appropriately use all the internet marketing tools.

I have used Microsoft Azure to implement webhooks in Azure Automation.

You can find out the implementation in the System Implementation part of Project.docx file.
